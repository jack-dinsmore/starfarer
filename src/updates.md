## May 9

Started. I'm using the vulkan tutorial [here](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/setup/base_code.html), which is written for the [vulkanalia](https://docs.rs/vulkanalia/0.14.0/vulkanalia/) crate, but I'm actually going to use the [ash](https://docs.rs/ash/0.37.0+1.3.209/ash/) crate because it's much more common.
